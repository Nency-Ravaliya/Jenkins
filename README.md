# Jenkins -- Pro

## 1. Declarative vs. Scripted Pipelines

### Declarative Pipelines

**Declarative pipelines** are designed to provide a simpler and more readable syntax. They use a defined structure and syntax, making it easier for users to understand the pipeline's intent.

**Example:**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any  // Defines the agent (executor) for the pipeline

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building...'
                // Add your build commands here
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing...'
                // Add your test commands here
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying...'
                // Add your deployment commands here
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        success {
            echo 'Pipeline succeeded!'
        }
        failure {
            echo 'Pipeline failed!'
        }
    }
}
```

### Scripted Pipelines

**Scripted pipelines** offer more flexibility and power by allowing users to write complex logic in the pipeline using Groovy syntax. They are more suitable for advanced users who require full control.

**Example:**

```groovy
node {
    try {
        stage('Build') {
            echo 'Building...'
            // Add your build commands here
        }
        stage('Test') {
            echo 'Testing...'
            // Add your test commands here
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            echo 'Deploying...'
            // Add your deployment commands here
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        echo "Pipeline failed: ${e.message}"
    } finally {
        // Post actions
        echo 'Cleanup actions can be performed here.'
    }
}
```

---

## 2. Stages and Steps

**Stages** represent a phase in the pipeline, while **steps** are the actual commands or actions that are executed within a stage.

### Example:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Compiling code...'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running tests...'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying application...'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

---

## 3. Post Actions

**Post actions** are executed after the stages have been run, and they can be configured to execute based on the result of the pipeline (success, failure, or always).

### Example:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building...'
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        success {
            echo 'Build was successful!'
        }
        failure {
            echo 'Build failed.'
        }
        always {
            echo 'This will always run, regardless of the build result.'
        }
    }
}
```

---

## 4. Pipeline Triggers

Triggers allow the pipeline to start automatically based on certain conditions like time (cron), source code changes (pollSCM), or external events (Git hooks).

### Example using Cron:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    triggers {
        cron('H 2 * * 1') // Triggers the pipeline every Monday at 2 AM
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building...'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Example using pollSCM:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    triggers {
        pollSCM('H/5 * * * *') // Polls the SCM every 5 minutes
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building...'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

---

## 5. Pipeline as Code (Jenkinsfile)

**Pipeline as Code** allows you to define your build process in a Jenkinsfile, making it easy to version control and manage. The Jenkinsfile can be placed in the root of your repository.

### Example Jenkinsfile:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building...'
                sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running tests...'
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying to server...'
                sh 'scp target/myapp.war user@server:/path/to/deploy'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

---

## 6. Multibranch Pipelines

**Multibranch Pipelines** allow Jenkins to automatically discover and manage branches in a source code repository. This is particularly useful for projects with multiple branches, enabling each branch to have its own pipeline.

### Example:

1. **Create a Multibranch Pipeline in Jenkins:**
   - Go to Jenkins Dashboard > New Item.
   - Choose "Multibranch Pipeline."
   - Configure the Git repository where your branches are located.

2. **Jenkinsfile for Each Branch:**
   Each branch can have its own `Jenkinsfile` with specific instructions.

**Example Jenkinsfile for the `develop` branch:**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building from develop branch...'
                sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running tests from develop branch...'
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Example Jenkinsfile for the `feature` branch:**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building from feature branch...'
                sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running tests from feature branch...'
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In Jenkins, the **Master-Agent architecture** allows you to distribute your build workload across multiple machines. This architecture consists of a master node that manages the Jenkins environment and one or more agent nodes (also known as slaves) that perform the actual build tasks. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of Jenkins Agents and Nodes, including how to set up a master-agent architecture, label nodes, connect nodes, and manage distributed builds.

## 1. Master-Agent Architecture

### Overview

- **Master Node**: The Jenkins master is responsible for managing the overall Jenkins environment. It schedules jobs, manages the user interface, and maintains the configuration.
- **Agent Nodes**: Agent nodes are separate machines that execute the build tasks. This allows you to distribute workloads and utilize resources more effectively.

### Setting Up Master and Agent Nodes

#### Step 1: Install Jenkins on the Master Node

1. **Install Jenkins**: Follow the installation instructions for your operating system (e.g., using `apt` for Ubuntu or `yum` for CentOS).
   
   ```bash
   # For Ubuntu
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install jenkins
   ```

2. **Start Jenkins**: Ensure Jenkins is running.

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start jenkins
   ```

3. **Access Jenkins**: Open a web browser and go to `http://your-master-ip:8080` to access the Jenkins dashboard.

#### Step 2: Set Up Agent Nodes

1. **Install Java**: Ensure Java is installed on the agent nodes as Jenkins requires Java to run.

   ```bash
   # Install Java
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
   ```

2. **Connect Agent Nodes to the Master Node**:
   - **Via SSH**: You can set up an SSH connection from the master to the agent.
   - **Via JNLP**: Alternatively, you can use JNLP for connecting the agent node to the master.

---

## 2. Labeling Nodes

**Node labeling** allows you to assign specific jobs to specific agents based on labels. This is useful when you have different types of jobs that require specific environments or resources.

### How to Label Nodes

1. **Access Node Configuration**:
   - Go to Jenkins dashboard > Manage Jenkins > Manage Nodes and Clouds.
   - Click on the agent node you want to label.

2. **Assign a Label**:
   - In the node configuration, find the **Labels** field and assign a label (e.g., `linux`, `windows`, `test`).
   - Save the configuration.

### Using Labels in Pipelines

You can specify the label in your pipeline script to ensure that the job runs on the correct agent.

#### Example:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent { label 'linux' } // Only runs on nodes with the 'linux' label

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building on a Linux agent...'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

---

## 3. Connecting Nodes

Jenkins agents can be connected to the master node using two main methods: **SSH** and **JNLP**.

### SSH Connection

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure that SSH is enabled on the agent node.
   - The master node must have SSH access to the agent node.

2. **Configure Agent Node**:
   - In Jenkins, go to Manage Jenkins > Manage Nodes and Clouds > New Node.
   - Choose **Permanent Agent** and configure the details.
   - In the **Launch method** dropdown, select **Launch agents via SSH**.

3. **Provide Connection Details**:
   - Enter the hostname, credentials (SSH user), and any other required details.

### JNLP Connection

1. **Configure Agent Node**:
   - In Jenkins, go to Manage Jenkins > Manage Nodes and Clouds > New Node.
   - Choose **Permanent Agent** and configure the details.
   - In the **Launch method** dropdown, select **Launch agents via Java Web Start**.

2. **Download the JNLP File**:
   - Once the agent node is configured, you can download the JNLP file from the node's configuration page.

3. **Run the Agent on the Node**:
   - Use the following command to run the agent:
   ```bash
   java -jar agent.jar -jnlpUrl http://your-master-ip:8080/computer/your-agent-name/slave-agent.jnlp -secret your-agent-secret
   ```

## 4. Distributed Builds

**Distributed builds** allow Jenkins to execute jobs across multiple agent nodes, optimizing the use of resources and reducing build times.

### Benefits of Distributed Builds

- **Increased Efficiency**: Multiple builds can be processed simultaneously.
- **Resource Optimization**: Utilize various hardware and software environments for testing.
- **Scalability**: Easily add more agents as project demands increase.

### Example of Distributed Builds

You can configure jobs to run on specific agents or distribute them evenly among available agents.

#### Example Pipeline with Distributed Builds:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent none // No default agent

    stages {
        stage('Build on Linux') {
            agent { label 'linux' }
            steps {
                echo 'Building on Linux agent...'
            }
        }
        stage('Build on Windows') {
            agent { label 'windows' }
            steps {
                echo 'Building on Windows agent...'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, two separate builds will be executed concurrently, one on a Linux agent and another on a Windows agent, leveraging the distributed build capabilities of Jenkins.

---

## Conclusion

By understanding Jenkins agents and nodes, you can effectively set up a master-agent architecture that optimizes your CI/CD process. Labeling nodes helps direct jobs to the appropriate environments, while distributed builds enhance efficiency and scalability, making Jenkins a powerful tool for managing complex software projects.
