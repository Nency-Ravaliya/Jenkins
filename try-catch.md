In Jenkins pipelines, both declarative and scripted syntax provide ways to handle errors using `try-catch` blocks. Here's how to implement error handling using `try-catch` in both types of pipelines:

### 1. **Declarative Pipeline with `try-catch`**

Declarative pipelines generally don't have a built-in `try-catch` mechanism like scripted pipelines, but you can use the `script` block to include a `try-catch` within a declarative pipeline.

#### Example:
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Example Stage') {
            steps {
                script {
                    try {
                        // Command that may fail
                        sh 'exit 1' // Example of a failing shell command
                    } catch (Exception e) {
                        echo "Caught an error: ${e}"
                        // Handle the error, such as sending a notification
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `script` block allows us to embed scripted pipeline syntax in a declarative pipeline.
- The `try-catch` handles any errors that occur within the `sh` command.

### 2. **Scripted Pipeline with `try-catch`**

In scripted pipelines, you can directly use `try-catch` for error handling without needing to embed it in a `script` block.

#### Example:
```groovy
node {
    try {
        stage('Build') {
            // Example of a failing shell command
            sh 'exit 1'
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        echo "Caught an error: ${e}"
        // Handle the error, such as sending a notification
    } finally {
        echo 'This will always run, even if there was an error.'
    }
}
```

In this scripted pipeline:
- `try-catch` is used to catch any exceptions raised by the `sh` command or any other step within the `try` block.
- The `finally` block ensures that some cleanup or notifications occur regardless of success or failure.

### Key Points:
- **Declarative Pipelines**: Use `try-catch` inside the `script` block.
- **Scripted Pipelines**: You can use `try-catch` directly without the need for a `script` block.
